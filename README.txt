João Recicla (joaorecicla repository)

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

Development started on 2020.12.16 as part of my Harvard CS50x 2020 Capstone Project.
My main goal is this work to outlive this course and mark my web developer career.

This is a web application for mapping where there is waste that can be recicled.
The users will sign in and add a amount of aluminium cans or PET bottles they have available at their homes.

As soon as there is enough volume or money value for a complete cargo worth of a trip to collect the garbage and direct it to a recicling plant, the application will elaborate and submit a report to the administrator to organize the route and schedule.

This application will be/is composed of:
-HTML website
-Tomcat server running in Java

This project is not open for contribution currently.
